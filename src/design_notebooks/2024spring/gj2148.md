# Design notebook for James Jin (2024 Spring)
## Feb. 5th - Feb. 11th, 2024
### Work done
- [Design notebook task]: was granted access to the repository and opened a pull request for this update.
### Working comments
I decided to join the processor design team after a discussion with professor Dey on my interest in a deeper understanding of computers' mechanisms. Due to my existing committments in the CS undergraduate research course, I have decided to enroll in the VIP with zero credits to familiarize myself with the work. However, I am particularly interested in optimizations and will aim to applying my theoretical / higher-level programming knowledge. Of course, I remain open to learning new things about hardware.
## Feb. 12th - Feb. 18th, 2024
### Work done
- [Lab 1](https://github.com/jamesjin0516/NYU_ProcDsgn_labs/tree/f3969d186efc78fa5548acedd006604f7a526ce8): completed the first lab using a WSL ubuntu distribution.
### Working comments
For each of the future weeks, I aim to complete at least 1 lab. At least with this 1st lab, I found my existing familiarity with some specific cmake and build tool commands allowed straightforward completion of the labs. Nevertheless, I learned the concepts of build tool, toolchain, and cmake.
## Feb. 19th - Feb. 25th, 2024
### Work done
- [Lab 2](https://github.com/jamesjin0516/onboarding-lab-2/tree/f8669e6806afa46e80abf051bebd261d74fd24ad): briefly begun lab 2
### Working comments
Due to extra research duties, I couldn't complete lab 2. Given next week's paper deadline, lab 2 will likely be further delayed. Nevertheless, I intend to at least update my cmake installation to enable building the project. Thus, I aim to complete and test another exercise.
