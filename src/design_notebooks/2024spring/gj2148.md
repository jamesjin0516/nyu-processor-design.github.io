# Design notebook for James Jin (2024 Spring)
## Feb. 5th - Feb. 11th, 2024
### Work done
- [Design notebook task]: was granted access to the repository and opened a pull request for this update.
### Working comments
I decided to join the processor design team after a discussion with professor Dey on my interest in a deeper understanding of computers' mechanisms. Due to my existing committments in the CS undergraduate research course, I have decided to enroll in the VIP with zero credits to familiarize myself with the work. However, I am particularly interested in optimizations and will aim to applying my theoretical / higher-level programming knowledge. Of course, I remain open to learning new things about hardware.
## Feb. 12th - Feb. 18th, 2024
### Work done
- [Lab 1](https://github.com/jamesjin0516/NYU_ProcDsgn_labs/tree/f3969d186efc78fa5548acedd006604f7a526ce8): completed the first lab using a WSL ubuntu distribution.
### Working comments
For each of the future weeks, I aim to complete at least 1 lab. At least with this 1st lab, I found my existing familiarity with some specific cmake and build tool commands allowed straightforward completion of the labs. Nevertheless, I learned the concepts of build tool, toolchain, and cmake.
## Feb. 19th - Feb. 25th, 2024
### Work done
- [Lab 2](https://github.com/jamesjin0516/onboarding-lab-2/tree/f8669e6806afa46e80abf051bebd261d74fd24ad): briefly begun lab 2
### Working comments
Due to extra research duties, I couldn't complete lab 2. Given next week's paper deadline, lab 2 will likely be further delayed. Nevertheless, I intend to at least update my cmake installation to enable building the project. Thus, I aim to complete and test another exercise.
## Feb. 26th - Mar. 3th, 2024
### Work done
- [Lab 2](https://github.com/jamesjin0516/onboarding-lab-2/tree/c0318a8fcff5f0ad3ab3cea043d5e4238d7fe44a): completed lab 2
### Working comments
Lab 2 is fully complete and tested. I found my memory of verilog syntax rusty, but my awareness of combinatorial vs. sequential logic is still strong. Critically, I learned the different implication of "`include" in verilog vs. in C++/C. I look forward to learning about writing tests in lab 3.
## Mar. 4th - Mar. 10th, 2024
### Work done
- [Lab 3](https://github.com/jamesjin0516/onboarding-lab-3/tree/30ea5f2a45cfa1bf23e7b21217fde3992a3b70db): completed exercise 1 (out of 4) for lab 3
### Working comments
After finishing the verilog code for the modules of lab 2, I am then tasked with writing C++ testcases for such verilog. I understood and implemented the basic strategy of iterating through all input combinations, simulate output, and verifying correctness.
## Mar. 11th - Mar. 17th, 2024
### Work done
- [Lab 3](https://github.com/jamesjin0516/onboarding-lab-3/tree/cf152c9eae836ff612343387ae2b51f472095bfd): completed exercise 2 for lab 3
### Working comments
While applying similar testing strategies as the start of lab 3, I leveraged the given credibility of the existing module and only tested unique combinations of bits that affect the output. This significantly reduced the amount of test cases required.
